¶This is for demonstration purposes only and should probably not be used to learn Greek. In fact it exists entirely to show how Peach deals with the distinction between intial/medial and final sigma when the user is asked for written answers.
¶
§#[P3]
¶
¶Most letters are where you would expect, t gets you a tau, and so forth. Besides the obvious, theta is produced by q, xi by x and chi by c. Alt+e gives you eta, Alt+o gives you omega, and Alt+i gives you the iota subscript. The rough and smooth breathing are produced by typing h or ' respectively BEFORE the letter to which they are to be applied; the grave, acute, circumflex and diaeresis marks are produced by typing \ or / or  ~ or " respectively AFTER the letter to which the mark is to be applied.

§#[P4]
¶
¶To explain what we’re doing here: the Greek alphabet has a couple of peculiarities. Their s is written differently according to whether it comes at the end of a word (ς) or elsewhere (σ); and although the Greeks has these two letters for s and one for p (π), they write ps as ψ. So we start off the alphabet normally enough ...
¶
a — α
b — β
c — χ
d — δ
ᵃe — η
e — ε
f — φ
g — γ
h — ῾
ᵃi — ͅ
i — ι
j — 
k — κ
l — λ
m — μ
n — ν
ᵃo — ω
o — ο
p — π
q — θ
r — ρ
¶
¶But when we get up to the P's and S's we turn every s into a σ, evey ς into a σ, every πσ into a ψ, and then every σ followed by a space into a ς followed by a space. (Peach will assume that every line of text begins and ends with a space just for the purpose of handling word boundaries appropriately. You don’t really need to know how this works, just that it will.) 
¶
s — σ
ς — σ
πσ — ψ
σ  — ς 
¶
¶The second step, converting every ς into an σ, is necessary because the thing that the user just typed might have made a ς into a non-final letter. So we turn them all into σ and then turn them back into ς if they’re word-final.
¶
¶Note that the order in which we do these things makes a difference. If we put those steps in the wrong order, it wouldn't work.
¶
¶Now let's finish off the alphabet.

§Introduction
¶
¶This demo exists entirely to check that the bit of Peach that handles cases like the Greek sigma works. (It does.) If you go to the Settings page then the notes in the Keyboard Settings sections will explain what is happening and why.

¶To type in Greek, most letters are where you would expect, t gets you a tau, and so forth. Besides the obvious, theta is produced by q, xi by x and chi by c. Alt+e gives you eta, Alt+o gives you omega, and Alt+i gives you the iota subscript. The rough and smooth breathing are produced by typing h or ' respectively BEFORE the letter to which they are to be applied; the grave, acute, circumflex and diaeresis marks are produced by typing \ or / or  ~ or " respectively AFTER the letter to which the mark is to be applied.
