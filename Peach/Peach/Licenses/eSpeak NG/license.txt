License Information

eSpeak NG Text-to-Speech is released under the GPL version 3 or later license.

The ieee80.c implementation is taken directly from ToFromIEEE.c.txt which has been made available for use in Open Source applications per the license statement on http://www.realitypixels.com/turk/opensource/. The only modifications made to the code is to comment out the TEST_FP define to make it useable in the eSpeak NG library, and to fix compiler warnings.

The getopt.c compatibility implementation for getopt support on Windows is taken from the NetBSD getopt_long implementation, which is licensed under a 2-clause BSD license.
